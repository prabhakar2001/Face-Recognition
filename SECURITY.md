## Reporting Security Issues

The Face-Recognition team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to address the issues in a timely manner.

To report a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** open an issue on the public GitHub repository. Security issues should be reported privately.

2. Send an email to [prabhakarjhasunny@gmail.com] with the subject: "[SECURITY] Issue Report".

3. Provide a clear description of the security issue, including:

   - A brief summary of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if applicable.
   - Any relevant details about the environment in which the vulnerability was discovered.

4. I will acknowledge your email within 24 hours, and I will work with you to validate and address the issue.

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not offer a formal bug bounty program for this project.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you practice responsible disclosure and give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before sharing any details publicly. We will keep you informed about our progress and coordinate the release of any information as necessary.

Thank you for helping to keep Face-Recognition safe and secure.
