# Face_Recognition_Tracking_Attendance
A python GUI integrated attendance system using face recognition to tracking attendance.

In this python project, I have made an attendance system which track attendance by using face recognition technique. I have also intergrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made on python using tkinter.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
1) tkinter for whole GUI
2) OpenCV for taking images and face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
3) CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime etc. for other purposes.
4) for installing modules we have to install all modules using command prompt
     4.1) pip install tk-tools
     4.2) pip install opencv-contrib-python
     4.3) pip install datetime
     4.4) pip install pytest-shutil
     4.5) pip install python-csv
     4.6) pip install numpy
