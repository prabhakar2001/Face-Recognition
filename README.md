This Python project is a user-friendly attendance system that utilizes face recognition to track attendance. It features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with tkinter to make it easily accessible to users. The technology stack includes OpenCV for capturing images and performing face recognition, along with various modules such as CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime, and others for additional functionalities.

To run the project, you need to install the required modules using the following commands in the command prompt or terminal:
1. `pip install tk-tools`
2. `pip install opencv-contrib-python`
3. `pip install datetime`
4. `pip install pytest-shutil`
5. `pip install python-csv`
6. `pip install numpy`
7. `pip install pillow`
8. `pip install pandas`
9. `pip install times`

A password is set for the registration process, which ensures security and restricts unauthorized access to the system. The password for registration is "prabhakar jha".

To mark attendance for a student, you need to press the 'p' key.

Key Features of the project include:
1. Interactive GUI for ease of use.
2. Password protection during new person registration.
3. Maintaining CSV files to store student details upon registration.
4. Daily creation of a new CSV file for attendance, with proper date and time entries.
5. Displaying live attendance updates for the day in tabular format on the main screen, showing student ID, name, date, and time.

The project was developed using Python version 3.8 and tested in the PyCharm IDE. It provides an efficient solution for tracking attendance using face recognition technology.
